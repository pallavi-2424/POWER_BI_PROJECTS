# AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Project

Welcome to the AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence project repository! This project has been successfully completed, transforming raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards that track key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this initial stage, I focused on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load project data using Power Query. I explored various data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more. Additionally, I connected to databases, extracted data from the web, and utilized QA & Profiling tools, text, numerical, date & time tools, rolling calendars, index & conditional columns, grouping & aggregating, pivoting & unpivoting, merging & appending queries, data source parameters, and importing Excel models.

## Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

During this stage, I followed data modeling best practices, emphasizing topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas. I meticulously built the AdventureWorks data model from the ground up, focusing on database normalization, fact & dimension tables, primary & foreign keys, star & snowflake schemas, active & inactive relationships, relationship cardinality, filter context & flow, bi-directional filters, model layouts, data formats & categories, and hierarchies.

## Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

Stage 3 introduced me to data analysis expressions (DAX). I created calculated columns and measures, explored topics like row and filter context, and practiced applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns. I covered DAX syntax & operators, math & stats functions, conditional & logical functions, the SWITCH function, text functions, date & time functions, the RELATED function, CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL, iterator (X) functions, and time intelligence patterns.

## Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

In this final stage, I brought the transformed data to life with reports and dashboards. I reviewed data visualization best practices and built and formatted basic charts, adding interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more. The visualizations included cards & KPIs, line charts, trend lines & forecasts, on-object formatting, table & matrix visuals, conditional formatting, top N filtering, map visuals, drill up, drill down & drillthrough, report slicers & interactions, bookmarks & page navigation, numeric & fields parameters, custom tooltips, importing custom visuals, managing & viewing roles (RLS), mobile layouts, and publishing to Power BI Service.
