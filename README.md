# AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Project

This GitHub repository hosts the AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence project, where we transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this initial stage, we focused on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load our project data using Power Query. We explored various data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more. Additionally, we connected to databases, extracted data from the web, and utilized QA & Profiling tools, text, numerical, date & time tools, rolling calendars, index & conditional columns, grouping & aggregating, pivoting & unpivoting, merging & appending queries, data source parameters, and importing Excel models.

## Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

In stage 2, we delved into data modeling best practices, emphasizing topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas. We built the AdventureWorks data model from the ground up, focusing on database normalization, fact & dimension tables, primary & foreign keys, star & snowflake schemas, active & inactive relationships, relationship cardinality, filter context & flow, bi-directional filters, model layouts, data formats & categories, and hierarchies.

## Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

Stage 3 introduced us to data analysis expressions (DAX). We created calculated columns and measures, explored topics like row and filter context, and practiced applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns. We covered DAX syntax & operators, math & stats functions, conditional & logical functions, the SWITCH function, text functions, date & time functions, the RELATED function, CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL, iterator (X) functions, and time intelligence patterns.

## Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

In this final stage, we brought our transformed data to life with reports and dashboards. We reviewed data visualization best practices and built and formatted basic charts, adding interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more. The visualizations included cards & KPIs, line charts, trend lines & forecasts, on-object formatting, table & matrix visuals, conditional formatting, top N filtering, map visuals, drill up, drill down & drillthrough, report slicers & interactions, bookmarks & page navigation, numeric & fields parameters, custom tooltips, importing custom visuals, managing & viewing roles (RLS), mobile layouts, and publishing to Power BI Service.
